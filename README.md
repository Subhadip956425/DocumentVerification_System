# AuthenChain - Automated Document Verification System

AuthenChain is an innovative document verification platform that leverages blockchain and AI technologies to provide secure, efficient, and tamper-proof verification of official documents. The platform addresses the need for secure document verification in sectors such as education, healthcare, and government by providing decentralized identity management, automated smart contracts, and AI-powered document authentication.


## Key Features:

- Smart Contracts for Document Verification
- Dynamic Access Control
- Decentralized Identity Management
- AI-Powered Document Authentication
- Immutable Records
- Global Accessibility
- Multilingual Support



## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, React.js, Bootstrap

**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, RESTful APIs

**Blockchain:** Solidity, Ethereum, Web3.js, IPFS, MetaMask

**AI/ML:** TensorFlow, OpenCV, Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**Security:** OAuth 2.0, AES-256 Encryption

**Additional Libraries:** purecounter.min.js, JWT, aos.js, qrcode.min.js


## Features and Benefits

**Immutability:** Document records on the blockchain cannot be altered or deleted.

**High Security:** Strong protection against fraud and tampering.

**Decentralization:** Eliminates reliance on a central authority, reducing the risk of control failure.

**Transparency:** Public, auditable transactions to build trust.

**Tamper-Proof:** Ensures that stored documents remain unaltered and authentic.

**Cost Efficiency:** Long-term reduction in verification costs compared to traditional systems.


## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (v14+)
- MetaMask (Chrome/Firefox extension)
- MongoDB (for database setup)
- Ethereum Wallet (for interacting with smart contracts)
